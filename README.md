# Crawler – Custom Homemade Replica of Berkeley's CS188 Reinforcement Learning Project

## Tentative TODOs

- [ ] Learn how to build a CS188's crawler-app-like interface in WxWidgets
- [ ] Learn how to work with pixels in WxWidgets
  - [ ] a) Use WxWidgets
  - [ ] b) Integrate SDL2 into WxWidgets GUI
- [ ] Build GUI
  - [ ] Create top and bottom panels
  - [ ] Add two buttons: ["run", "stop"]
- [ ] Create graphics:
  - [ ] Create crawler's body
    - [ ] Create a function Body::walk() where the crawler walks automatically; for reference – [this repo](https://github.com/rwwaskk/CS188-Berkeley/blob/master/reinforcement/crawler.py)
